Everyone already has the friends they know and the things they talk about and I don’t know when the right time to pitch in is. It feels so weird to me to just hop in to a conversation but I also don’t know how else I could properly interact with people. I have a total of one friend who puts up with my awkwardness irl, and they don’t really use discord. I have one friend I made on overwatch a few years ago that I talk to with discord but we don’t share any servers since I stopped playing overwatch.

From buggy whips to Blockbuster, entire industries have been built around specific tech products. They thrived and, unless they evolved, they inevitably died. That's because when it comes to technological innovation, the goal line is always moving. As soon as someone develops a groundbreaking new technology, someone else begins working on a way to improve upon or replace it. From movies to music, telephones to typewriters, no technology is as it was. Even the original tech product, the humble wheel, has now evolved to include aggressive tread patterns laser-etched into synthetic rubber to allow for multi-season, all-weather performance traction—all of which probably will soon be replaced by something better.  Younger generations mock and marvel at the primitive tech their parents used while reveling in the incredible form and function of their own amazing gadgets, only to watch them eventually age into obsolescence just like everything that came before. Technology is now evolving so rapidly that the latest and newest products have painfully short shelf lives, and the 2.0 version of everything you own soon will command your attention and your dollars. Sometimes, however, you have to step back to see how far you've come.

Query: Hmm, let me think. I'm feeling pretty curious about the history of the English language today. Maybe we could look into that?
Result: The English language, as we know it today, is a rich tapestry woven from centuries of cultural exchange, invasions, and internal transformations. From its humble origins in the 5th century to its global dominance in the 21st century, English has evolved dramatically, adapting to various social, political, and technological changes. The vocabulary was also quite different, with many words being borrowed from other languages such as Latin, French, and Old Norse. The first account of Anglo-Saxon England ever written is from 731 AD - a document known as the Venerable Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, which remains the single most valuable source from this period. The history of the English language really started with the arrival of three Germanic tribes who invaded Britain during the 5th century AD. These tribes, the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes, crossed the North Sea from what today is Denmark and northern Germany. At that time the inhabitants of Britain spoke a Celtic language.

Digging deeper into https://www.thearchaeologist.org/blog/the-evolution-of-the-english-language-a-detailed-journey-through-time: The English language, as we know it today, is a rich tapestry woven from centuries of cultural exchange, invasions, and internal transformations. From its humble origins in the 5th century to its global dominance in the 21st century, English has evolved dramatically, adapting to various social, political, and technological changes. Let’s explore this fascinating journey in detail, tracing the evolution of the English language across four major periods: Old English, Middle English, Early Modern English, and Modern English. English first began to take shape with the migration of the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes to Britain in the 5th century. These tribes, originally from regions in what is now Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands, brought with them West Germanic dialects that eventually merged to form what we call Old English. The language of this era was far removed from modern English and would be largely incomprehensible to contemporary speakers. Phonology: Old English had a complex system of vowels and consonants, many of which no longer exist in modern English. Pronunciation was vastly different, marked by a variety of sounds that disappeared over time or were modified through later linguistic shifts.
